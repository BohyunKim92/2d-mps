# CSV files

- `equispacing_min_50.csv`--these data were generated with $m_B = N, m_I =
  \min(N, 50)$. Boundary points were sampled equally spaced along each edge.
  "Real" eigenvalues were taken from the Reviving paper.
- `equispacing_0.4N.csv`--these data were generated with $m_B = N, m_I = 0.4
  N$. Boundary points were sampled equally spaced along each edge. "Real"
  eigenvalues were taken from the Reviving paper.
- `equispacing_N.csv`--these data were generated with $m_B = N, m_I = N$.
  Boundary points were sampled equally spaced along each edge. "Real"
  eigenvalues were taken from the Reviving paper.
